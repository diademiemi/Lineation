# Lineation

## About
Lineation is a plugin for Spigot Minecraft servers that can create lines for minigames. This can make hosting events with contests for race minigames easier to manage.  
Start lines can contain players until a countdown reaches zero and they are allowed to start. The finish line then counts for players passing it and can close the lines after a certain amount of people win.  

## Purpose
This plugin was written as a replacement to a current approach using command blocks for start and finish lines on a Minecraft server. Lineation makes it easier to manage lines and allows staff to create lines without having to give them access to command blocks. Since we use these to host events with contests and giveaways, this plugin has a feature to only allow players to win a certain amount of times, after that they are ignored by the finish line.  

## Note
This is my first time creating a Minecraft plugin, so feedback is greatly appreciated!   
Huge thanks to [@jeremynoesen](https://github.com/jeremynoesen) for helping a great amount with the code, creating the plugin logo and allowing me to inspect and take inspiration from his earlier Minecraft plugins.
