# Lineation

## About

Lineation is a plugin for Spigot Minecraft servers that can create lines for minigames. This can make hosting events with contests for racing minigames easier to manage.  
Start lines can contain players until a countdown reaches zero and they are allowed to start. While the race is on, the finish line counts for players passing it and can close the lines after a certain amount of people win.  

## Purpose

This plugin was written as a replacement to a current approach using command blocks for start and finish lines during player races on a Minecraft server. Lineation makes it easier to manage lines, track winners of races and allows staff to create lines without having to give them access to command blocks. Since we use these to host events with contests and giveaways, this plugin has a feature to only allow players to win a certain amount of times, after that they are ignored by the finish line.
