HELP_AREAS: |2-
  &f&l[ &8&l-&f&l-&8&l- &f&lLineation &8&l-&f&l-&8&l-&f&l ]&r
  &rA line's area is used to detect players, and to know where the line is located.
  The center of the area is used to calculate the distance to a player, used in the messagereach option.
  In starting lines, it is possible to teleport all players in the area to a location when the line starts with the teleport option.
  In finish lines, this area is used to detect players. It's vital to set an area that players enter or cross through when they should finish.
  &7If your players are moving at a high speed, such as in elytra races, be sure to set a large area. If your server is lagging, not doing so could result in missed player wins.  
HELP_BORDERS: |2-
  &f&l[ &8&l-&f&l-&8&l- &f&lLineation &8&l-&f&l-&8&l-&f&l ]&r
  &rYou can set borders on lines, these are cuboid shapes where blocks will be set when the line is stopped.
  In finish lines, the block that is set when the line is stopped is defined in the block option.
  To change the block used, run &7&o/lineation line <line> option block <block>&r.
  In start lines, there is a countdown which is defined by the blocksequence option.
  For every block defined in the blocksequence option after the first (The resting position), the borders will take one second to start.
  By default this is set to &7"glass, red_stained_glass, yellow_stained_glass, lime_stained_glass"&r, this creates a countdown of 3 seconds. 
GUIDE_CREATED_START: |2-
