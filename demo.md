Step 1 | Step 2
First I create a start and finish line<br> And then I link these two together<br> So they start and stop at the same time | I then set the first border for this start line

Step 3 | Step 4
I then define a second border for the start line<br> This way the players can not jump over the line | I then set an area for this start line<br>In start lines this is only for sending the messages<br>So I make this area big to include potential spectators

Step 5 | Step 6
I now set a border for the finish line | And finally, I set an area for the finish line too<br>In finish lines this is the area used to detect players

It's all set up now! See the GIF underneath for a demonstration of what I just set up in action.
